               <h2>Teeth Whitening</h2>
               <img src="images/services/Whitening_Fotolia_52843636_S_580x186.jpg" alt="Teeth Whitening before and after photos." title="Teeth Whitening before and after photos."/>
               <p>Teeth whitening is a very safe and effective way to enhance the natural beauty of your smile. It involves applying a whitening gel on the outer surface of your teeth, which penetrates the hard enamel surface and breaks down the internal stain particles. Teeth whitening does not weaken the tooth surface, but it may make your teeth sensitive to cold for 1-3 days after the procedure. This is minimized with the application of fluoride-based desensitizer. It is recommended that you have your teeth examined and cleaned by a professional prior to whitening.</p>
               <h2>Veneers</h2>
               <p>A veneer is a wafer-thin translucent ceramic/porcelain shell that is placed over the tooth with a special tooth-colored cement (glue). Veneers are mostly used on front teeth to help correct esthetic flaws such as small tooth gap, minor tooth misalignment, minor tooth chips, unsatisfactory tooth coloration and local discolorations.</p>
               <h2>Bonding</h2>
               <p>An alternative to veneers is tooth bonding. Bonding is a type of restoration for chipped, discolored, or misaligned teeth and can be done in one office visit. It is a great way to repair teeth when you are short on time, for a special event for example. It is important to note that the resin used in bonding is not as strong as tooth enamel and is more likely to chip, stain, or break than natural teeth. Bonding typically lasts 3 to 5 years before repair or replacement is needed.</p>
               <h2>Six Month Smile Cosmetic Braces</h2>
               <img src="images/services/cosmetic-braces-BeforeAfter_580x170.jpg" alt="Before and After photos." title="Before and After photos."/>
               <p>Six Month Smiles (6MS) is a cosmetically focused, short term treatment to straighten teeth for adults (15yrs and older). Like traditional metal braces, 6MS uses slow controlled force to move your teeth into place but unlike traditional braces, the 6MS braces are clear and the wire is tooth colored so you will not be showing a "metal mouth". Because it is a cosmetically focused treatment, the average time of completion is around 6 months. At the consultation appointment, the doctor will evaluate your overall smile and determine the length of treatment.</p>
